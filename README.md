# Design Patterns Implementation in Java

This repository contains implementations of all major **Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns** using **Java**.  
The goal of this project is to understand **object-oriented design principles**, **loose coupling**, **reusability**, and **scalable architecture** through practical examples.

---

## About

Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems.  
This project demonstrates **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** design patterns with clear examples.

Each pattern is implemented in a separate folder with well-structured classes for easy understanding.

---

## Creational Design Patterns

These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

* Simple Factory Pattern
* Factory Pattern
* Abstract Factory Pattern
* Builder Pattern
* Prototype Pattern
* Singleton Pattern

**Folders:**
`SimpleFactoryPattern/`, `FactoryPattern/`, `AbstractFactoryPattern/`, `Builder/`, `PrototypePattern/`, `SingleTonPattern/`

---

## Structural Design Patterns

These patterns deal with object composition and typically help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to change.

* Adapter Pattern
* Bridge Pattern
* Composite Pattern
* Decorator Pattern
* Facade Pattern
* Flyweight Pattern
* Proxy Pattern

**Folders:**
`AdapterPattern/`, `BridgePattern/`, `CompositePattern/`, `DecoratorPattern/`, `FacadePattern/`, `FlyweightPattern/`, `ProxyPattern/`

---

## Behavioral Design Patterns

These patterns deal with communication between objects and how responsibilities are assigned between them.

* Chain of Responsibility
* Command Pattern
* Interpreter Pattern
* Iterator Pattern
* Mediator Pattern
* Memento Pattern
* Observer Pattern
* State Pattern
* Strategy Pattern
* Template Pattern
* Visitor Pattern

**Folders:**
`ChainOfResponsibility/`, `CommandPattern/`, `InterpretorPattern/`, `IteratorPattern/`, `MediatorPattern/`, `MementoPattern/`, `ObserverPattern/`, `StatePattern/`, `StrategyPattern/`, `TemplatePattern/`, `VisitorPattern/`

## Requirements
* Java JDK 8 or higher
* An IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/bandi-rajashree21/design-patterns/.git`
2. Navigate to the specific pattern folder.
3. Compile and run the `Main` or `Demo` class to see the pattern in action.
